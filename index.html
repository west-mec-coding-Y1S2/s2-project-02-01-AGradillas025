        For the Aside element I added in some information from the jtc_pages.txt that were the comments of the people that were reviewed and added in a image link for jtc_comments.png. After that, I set the reviews into blockquotes and in the blockqoutes the actual comment the reviewer made I set those as a paragraph with a paragraph element and after that I set the actual reviwers names in a cite element with the code &#8212; right before the reviewers name and I did that for all the reviews.

                I hired Jedds to remove an old Sugar maple from a narrow yard. They did the job with no damage to my garage andcleanedit
                all up that same day. Great service.

                Jedds Tree Care promptly came to examine a downed tree and provide an estimate for its removal. They did the job fast and
                at the lowest bid. I'll call them again without hesitation for future lawn and garden needs.

                Their team took down five trees in one day and did an immaculate clean-up. They took extra care not to disturb my lawn and
                garden. I highly recommend their service.

        For the article I added a header and within the header I added a image link for jt_photo1.png and I setted it as Jedds Tree Care. Furthermore, I went to jtc_pages.txt and set the second section of it, including the contact information, and I set it up right after the header and I set the 2 paragraphs in a paragraph element and spaced out the 2 paragraphs out with <br>. Finally after all that I created a address link right after the paragraphs and I setted Jedds Tree Care in a strong element and I spaced out the address and then I spaced out the email away from the address and I set the email in a mail link. Right after that I spaced ou the email and the phone and I set the phone in a phone link.
